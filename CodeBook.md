Course Project: Getting and Cleaning Data
=========

### Raw Data

Data was collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

The raw data was downloaded from
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

The raw data zip file contains a README.txt with a list of the different files and their contents.

### Code Book
The tidy data set consists of the average measurement for each activity and subject. 
Subjects are identified by their subject_id, activities by their name (SITTING, WALKING, etc.)

The complete list of columns is:
```
subject_id

Only mean and standard deviation measurements were considered for the "tidy" dataset.
